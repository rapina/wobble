# Localize
When adding or modifying user-facing text:
1. Find all locale files in the locales directory
2. Add the new key to EVERY locale file
3. Use the existing translation style/tone for each language
4. Verify no hardcoded strings remain in the modified component
5. Run the build to confirm no missing key errors
